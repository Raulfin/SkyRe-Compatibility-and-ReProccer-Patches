SkyRe Compatibility and ReProccer Patches
=====================================

Updates, fixes and support for T3nd0s Skyrim Redone ([SkyRe] (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/9286)) and [ReProccer] (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/28467) mods.

[SkyRe Compatibility and ReProccer Patches] (http://www
.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/48629/?) is maintained on the [Nexus] (http://www.nexusmods.com).

The main function of this repository will be as an issue tracker. Make sure you have checked the [Troubleshooting] (http://nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/48629/?tab=4&&navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fskyrim%2Fajax%2Fcomments%2F%3Fmod_id%3D48629%26page%3D1%26sort%3DDESC%26pid%3D0%26thread_id%3D1806535&pUp=1) post before making an issue here.

When creating an issue use a subject prefix to help identify it a bit easier (USKRP, Pre/Post Patch, Other patch, Patch Requst) there are tons of files offered so something like "iron sword is bad" will be ignored.
